              <div class="bio"><center><font color="#1ABEF7"><h2>CHARACTER BIO</h2></font></center><p>Charming, sexy and sophisticated, Neal Caffrey is one of the world's greatest con artists. After escaping from prison - and getting caught by the man who put him there in the first place, Agent Peter Burke - Neal strikes a bargain: in exchange for his freedom, Neal will help the FBI catch the most elusive White Collar criminals in the country.</p><p>Since then, Neal has walked the line between his role as a top FBI asset and his old life as a criminal mastermind. Though Neal's actions haven't always been above board, over time, his relationship with Peter has deepened into a real friendship and he has slowly come to realize he has an honest life worth keeping in New York.</p><p>However, good intentions don't always amount to good deeds, and as Neal has struggled to stay on the right side of the law, he has often hurt those closest to him. The recent return of his fugitive father had Neal revisiting a chapter in his life that he had long thought closed, but Neal’s family reunion ended in tragedy when his father shot a corrupt senator and went on the run, leaving Peter to take the fall.</p><p>Now, Neal’s attempt to make things right will put him in a compromising position with an old adversary. And when one audacious act sets off a chain of events that have consequences for everyone around him, it will leave the con-turned-consultant questioning just who he is at heart.</p></div>
