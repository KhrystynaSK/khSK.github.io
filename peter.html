              <div class="bio"><center><font color="#1ABEF7"><h2>CHARACTER BIO</h2></font></center><p>A no-nonsense federal agent in the FBI's White Collar Crime Unit, Peter Burke believes in earning success the old-fashioned way, through perseverance and hard work.</p><p>It took him years of both, along with the steadfast support of his loving wife, Elizabeth, to finally catch elusive white-collar criminal Neal Caffrey. Despite his initial trepidations, Peter agreed to take the wily crook on as a partner.</p><p>Since then, Peter has been equal parts exasperated and inspired by Neal as they have taken down some of the most notorious criminals in the city. Over time, their relationship has deepened into a real friendship, and just as Peter has tried to guide Neal towards a more honest life, so too has Neal influenced Peter by teaching him to think outside strict FBI lines.</p><p>However, Neal's actions have also put both Peter and Elizabeth's lives in danger on more than one occasion, and when the return of Neal’s fugitive father ended with the shooting of a corrupt Senator, Peter wound up in a prison cell. But while his faith in the system remains resolute, his faith in his partner will be shaken, and Peter will soon question just what kind of future he has with Neal Caffrey around.</p></div>
