Likewise, Diana's loyalty to Peter has never wavered, even as Neal's presence has turned the department into a roller coaster ride that has at times threatened their jobs.</p><p>Diana's personal life has also seen some ups and downs, and though her relationship with her former fiancé Christie has ended, Diana has decided to begin a new chapter and start a family. However, the prospect of single motherhood will soon bring up reservations that will leave the normally fearless agent uncertain about her future at home and at work.</p></div>
