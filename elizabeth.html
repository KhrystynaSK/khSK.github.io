Peter's stubbornness is offset by Elizabeth's ability to see both sides of a situation, and she often plays the role of her husband's moral compass.</p><p>When Peter teamed up with Neal Caffrey, Elizabeth had her doubts, but she quickly warmed to the charming con man. And even though her friendship with Neal and Mozzie has put her in harm’s way on more than one occasion, it has also revealed Elizabeth’s reserves of inner strength – and made life a little more exciting.</p><p>However, the life of an FBI wife is never easy, and a tragedy in the department will soon leave Elizabeth wondering just how deep that strength runs.</p></div>
